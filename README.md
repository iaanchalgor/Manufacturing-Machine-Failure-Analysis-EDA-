# Manufacturing-Machine-Failure-Analysis-EDA-


📘 Project Overview
This project focuses on exploring manufacturing process data to identify key patterns and correlations related to machine failures.  
It includes data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization using Python and libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

📊 Dataset
Features include:
- Machine Type  
- Air Temperature [K]  
- Process Temperature [K]  
- Rotational Speed [rpm]  
- Torque [Nm]  
- Tool Wear [min]  
- Target (Failure Indicator)

⚙️ Tools Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

🧠 Key Insights
- Higher tool wear and torque strongly correlate with failure occurrence.  
- Process and air temperature differences indicate machine stress levels.  

 🚀 Next Steps
Model building for predictive maintenance using ML algorithms (Random Forest, Logistic Regression).
